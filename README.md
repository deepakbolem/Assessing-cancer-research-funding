# Assessing-cancer-research-funding
Assessing if government research funding meets the need in terms of fiscal burden of cancer. 

Areas where I concentrated on addressing business problems.

What is the financial implication of cancer treatment across the (i) US states and (ii) for different cancer types/phases?
Which ethnic groups are most susceptible to cancer challenges?
What is the relationship between the government’s cancer research funding and patient’s out-of-pocket cost?

Reason for picking this topic and question(s)

Cancer is increasing worldwide. The formulation of plans related to cancer support and their success hinges upon understanding the interplay of different factors such as cost of treatment, number of people getting affected, ethnic susceptibility, and financial research support. It can potentially help to decrease cancer implication, including deaths due to cancer. A better understanding would lead to right distribution of funding and efforts, including cancer care and treatment for each cancer type.

Stakeholders interested in this question(s): Government, insurance Companies, hospitals, cancer support organization, cancer research institutes and public (for awareness)

The results of the analysis are ultimately for government healthcare agencies that are planning to roll out the financial support program. The data can help the agency to understand the fiscal burden of cancer across different cancer types. Moreover, the agency can concentrate on specific cancer types based on the incidence/deaths or out-of-pocket cost per patient, and thus increase funding in such areas.
